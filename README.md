# How to use
Put the donation data file into the directory "./input" and name it as "itcont.txt", also put the percentile data file into the same directory "./input" and name it as "percentile.txt".

Run the bash file "./run.sh".

Then you should get a output file in the directory "./output" whose name should be "repeat_donors.txt".
